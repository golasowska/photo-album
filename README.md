photo-album app has been created using React and Redux and it was bootstrapped with Create React App.

This is a simple photo gallery that utilizes Flickr API as a photo database.

If you click on the photo at the slide bar at the bottom the big photo in the center of the page will change and animate.

In the searchbar that appears on the main page, just enter the searched phrase.
The pictures related to the tag will be uploaded.
